Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software Engineer is the use of programming languages to creat things like websites and apps 
.it help businesses run smoothly and reach more customers.
.it has developed important apps and website that are important in day to day activities 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
. The creation of high level programing languages wich made it much easier for people to write
.The development of object oriented programming it changed how we design software and it let's us creat reusable codes that's much easier to maintain 
.The rise of the open source movement it transfomed software development by encouraging collaboration and sharing of codes

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
. planning phase -budget and timeline is set 
. Requirement phase- little sketches are made 
. Design phase- find out technical details to be used
. Development phase - actually coding happens
. Testing phase- fix any bugs found 
. Deployment phase- software is released to the users
. Maintenance phase- software is kept to date and any problems that pop up are fixed


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
.waterfall and Agile are both project management methodologies 
. water fall is a more rigid process while Agile is more flexible 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
.A software developer,use codes to figure out the most effective way to make product ideas work.
.Quality Assurance engineer they think like the users to find any possible problem 
. project manager they make decisions sometimes on the fly to solve problems that come up

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
. Integrated development environment make coding faster and less frustrating example Visual studio code while the version control system keeps codes safe example the Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
. pressure to deliver high quality software on tigth deadlines 
. dealing with constant shifting project requirements 
some of the strategic used are
.They focuse on continuous learning 
.Use alot of project management techniques 
.Relay heavily on teamwork and communication 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.using the scenario of building a wall 
.Unit we will test individual Brick 
. integration we make sure the tested brick can be joined 
. system we test the whole wall to see if it can support the weight it needs to 
. acceptance here we have some inspect the finished wall to make sure it functions well
This testing help find and fix problems earlier wich saves time.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in
interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is crafting the perfect questions or requests to get the best results from AI


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
.write a story about a cat
. write a story about a grumpy cat who lives in a big city and hates dogs
The second prompt is more effective because it gives the AI specific details to work with like the cat's personality and where it lives.
